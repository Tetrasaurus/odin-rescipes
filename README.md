First project for the TOP

Looks like so far this project is set to challenge the topics Ive learnt and what I remember.

The goal of the project is to create a "recipe" html webpage with links to separate pages, all the while remembering to use Git and useful commits. It should be a interesting test to see how much Ive actually absorbed!

I have to admit I have done a few other course and could say was fairly confident on the topics learnt through the follow along code video courses and was able to build half decent webpages but I now realised I had such a small level of understanding and based all my ideas off the content I "followed along"

I am excited to start building from a better core understanding, challenging myself - even though its a simple first project:]
